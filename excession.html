					<p><i>Background | learning my most important edgeweights</i></p>
						<p>I think my mind is mostly nodes and edgeweights and that the overall resolution of the system increased rapidly during childhood. That makes the edgeweight adjustments early in life vastly more impactful than those later on down the road. I grew up in a small farm town called Hope, NJ. My dad is a carpenter and my mom is a house cleaner and a great cook. From them, among other things, I learned a great love for creating and inventing things - whether in the kitchen or through construction - and for helping people. Math and science came easy to me and I enjoyed solving problems for fun.</p>

					<h1>At Harvard | finding CS and AI</h1>
					<p><i>At Harvard | finding CS and AI</i></p>
						<p>When I got to Harvard, I thought I would study math. I took a course freshman year where the final project was building a small electric model car that could beat an arbitrary maze using light sensors and ultrasonics. This was the first time I was introduced to programming. That work was in C on a cypress PSoC. Once we understood the constraints of the maze, I went with code consisting of some pretty gross nested if statements and hard coding motor duration for 90 degree turns on full battery, then made sure we only did our test runs on full battery, as allowed in the probelm constraints. We won. I was hooked. Programming was a whole new space in which I could invent. Other notable projects at Harvard were creating and programming a new type of play for the RoboCup team (ricocheting the ball off of a teammate to score a goal), programming a MIPS processor that could run Assembly in software all the way up from a NOT gate, creating an automated retail store proof-of-concept (in 2008), and various other projects. My senior year, I took a course in AI and ML and knew in my gut I was learning something profoundly important. The projects completed in that course gave me a glimpse of the impact AI and, specifically, AGI, could have on humanity. I was elected as a leader to a few groups and clubs on campus. Before graduating, a former Varsity Football teammate (and fellow Computer Science major) reached out, he was now working in the Colts front office. Head Coach Jim Caldwell wanted a chart, based on data, that would tell him when to call Timeout in a specific game situation. This was a fun and difficult project.</p>
					<div data-role="collapsible">
						<h1>Colts ML Project</h1>
						<p><i>Colts ML Project</i></p>
							<p>There is a situation, common in football, when a team is winning the game with approximately 4 minutes left and possesses the ball on offense. During this situation, the team on offense generally changes their style of play to try to run out the clock as quickly as possible to get to the end of the game. This presents a challenge for the losing team on defense. Head Coach Jim Caldwell of the Indianapolis Colts, wanted a chart that told him when to call timeout to maximize their chances of getting the ball back and having enough time left to win the game.</p>
							<p>I was a member of a team of three. The other two teammates were a teaching fellow from my AI course and another teammate with programming chops but no AI experience. I decided we should use an MDP, did most of the heavy lifting in determining how to structure our states, collecting our data, building the transition function, and constructing our reward function.</p>
							<p>We were presented with only two seasons of well-structured NFL data. When we filtered to the plays relevant to our task, we had far too few plays to be able to have specific enough state definitions to create any meaningful solution. So I decided to parse additional years of play-by-play string data to generate a dataset large enough to use. After many tweaks based on the data available and some decisions based on our gut (from playing the sport for so many years) we tweaked the parameters of the MDP enough to produce a chart we were proud to present to the team.</p>
							<p>The Colts were pretty terrible that year so they were only in two games where this situation came up. They won one and lost one which is better than the 8.5% average winning performance in this scenario. Sample size is very small, obviously, and Jim Caldwell got fired for the team's 2-14 record that year so we were unable to track the results for our project over time.</p>

					<p><i>Recruiting | Finding a Job, but not yet my career</i></p>
						<p>After graduation, I interviewed with a tech company, Microsoft. They wanted me to work on Xbox improvements - this was not the problem solving and inventing type of work I enjoyed. During my final round interview of six total, I finally got asked the question, "why do you want to work on Xbox?" I realized I didn't, was truthful in my answer and said what actually motivated me, and flew back home to the East Coast without a job offer. I went back to the drawing board and realized that to invent things for myself and launch my own company, I could probably use some business experience.</p>

					<p><i>At Anheuser-Busch InBev | on-the-job MBA</i></p>
						<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev was recruiting for their Global Management Trainee Program on campus and I decided to interview. Throughout the process, the culture and people stood out to me as a good fit, given their competitive, meritocratic nature. The program felt right because I was looking for general business knowledge to be able to work for myself creating things for a living. I was one of 13 selected from a pool of 100k for the program. Below are some projects in chronological order:</p>
						<div data-role="collapsible">
							<h1>Operations | Increasing Line Efficiency at Merrimack Facility</h1>
							<p><i>Operations | Increasing Line Efficiency at Merrimack Facility</i></p>
								<p>Changover time between different pack configurations was killing line efficiency at our Merrimack Brewery. I decided to optimize our packaging schedule to minimize line downtime based on historical changeover transition times. I built a transition model, looked ahead to what we needed to package and spit out the optimum schedule to minimize line downtime. Line efficiencey increased significantly and the solution was scaled out to the other lines at the plant.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible">
							<h1>Sales | Increasing Sales at Liquor Stores</h1>
							<p><i>Sales | Increasing Sales at Liquor Stores</p></i>
								<p>Ran national sales strategy for the Package Liquor sales channel at Anheuser Busch, built and deployed a national program that cost $4m and resulted in $8m sales lift through resegmenting all US liquor stores based on real store data, then targeting sampling, price recommendations, and trade marketing assets based on that segmentation model.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible">
							<h1>Product Design and Management | Semi Bar and Restaurant and IoT Video Coolers</h1>
							<p><i>Product Design and Management | Semi Bar and Restaurant and IoT Video Coolers</i></p>
								<p>Product Manager (from design to deploy to service) for various CAPEX Projects at AB - Two examples are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGKme6FeyCs">Bud and Burgers Semi Trailer</a> as part of Bud and Burgers National Campaign and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8FsgoVbux4">4G IoT Video Cooler </a> (deployed >2,000)</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible">
							<h1>Experiential Marketing | Driving Sales Through Customer Experience</h1>
							<p><i>Experiential Marketing | Driving Sales Through Customer Experience</i></p>
								<p>Ran several multi-million-dollar marketing campaigns for Budweiser and Bud Light (everything from briefing agencies, to celebrity partnership management, to budget management, to on site event execution) that drove increases in past four week penetration (a sales KPI in the consumer packaged goods world) and brand equity.</p>
						</div>
						<div data-role="collapsible">
							<h1>Strategy | Customer Valuation Model</h1>
							<p><i>Strategy | Customer Valuation Model</i></p>
								<p>Built a long term valuation model for customer experience based on historical data and implemented a new strategy based on this model resulting in 1.5x ROI improvement of all Experiential Marketing spend at Anheuser Busch (through cutting out inefficient executions, scaling those with more leverage, and planning new projects based on the levers that would drive value).</p>

								Head of Owned Retail Business Unit at Anheuser Busch (last 24 months - full P&L responsibility)
								<p>This role didn't exist previously. I was tasked with uniting the brewpub and taproom teams of 12 acquired craft breweries into a single Business Unit and increasing scale, quality, revenue, and profitability. I managed a small national team directly but was responsible for the work and well-being of  >1,600 people in the field across 30 locations nationwide.

								<p>Grew Net Revenue from $78m to $100m</p>
								<p>Expanded EBITDA margin from 4% to 10%</p>
								<p>Reduced annual CAPEX spend from $30m to $10m while still opening the same number of new units annually and reducing average payback period to <3 years</p>
								<p>Managed the business across many states with their own individual legal constraints in a highly regulated industry that follows a three tier distribution system (similar situations to the recent headache in Texas re: restricting servicing your own vehicles)</p>
								<p>How - Hired, trained, and retained good people, established processes and standardized non-consumer-facing systems, eliminated processes that were not adding value, established excellence program, established a dream and annual summit to get everyone chasing the same vision, trained a neural network to classify reviews based on type (good/bad food, service, or beer) so we could react appropriately and quickly, created clear dashboards and business cycle to open and close gaps, closed poor quality, unprofitable locations, sold-in and implemented new rewards/incentive structure to drive the right results</p>

					<h1>Defining my life goal and how I want to use my limited time</h1>
					<p><i>Defining my life goal and how I want to use my limited time</i></p>
						<p>About two years ago, I had a "what am I doing with the limited time left in my life?" point of reflection. My whole life I've loved creating things and had the dream that I would make some scientific or mathematical breakthrough that would advance our knowledge and, hopefully, well-being as a species. I forgot about chasing that after too many years at AB. Many of the best minds of our generation are spending their time trying to get you to click on more ads, that's an incredibly depressing fact to face. I don't want to spend my time and effort on trying to get folks to buy more beer. I want to help humanity. In late 2015 I realized that I was getting too comfortable and before long, when we would start having kids, I may not be willing to take a risk and chase my dream while being confident I could support my family, so solving the problem became more urgent. At that point, I reset, reestablished my goals and vision and made a plan to get there. </p><p>I now have a clear goal: <b><u>I want to leave humanity in a better place than I found it.</u></b> The two ways I will accomplish this are through <u>building strong relationships</u> (like making sure I raise my kids to be better than myself) and through some <u>technical work to advance humanity.</u></p><p>I had some ideas and a basic design for an AGI that I wanted to build and test, I thought this was the best project for me and it feels right in my gut that the principles I've written down are necessary for an AGI to work. I also know that working on this project would consume me and likely destroy my family if I did it as a nights and weekends project so I needed to make a plan to generate automated income to allow me to work on this project full time.</p><p>The plan was simple: <br/>1. Run a business unit at AB to close out my on-the-job MBA. <br/>2. Invent something and launch an automated business selling it. <br/>3. Quit and use my time to work on my AGI project and strengthen my relationships.</p>

					<p><i>Pizza Shelf | Part 2 of the Plan</i></p>
						<p>So with that plan in mind, I invented something I enjoyed using and realized that other people wanted it. Leveraging my nights and weekends, I started a company around it designed to be as automated as possible so I could reallocate my time to important projects for humanity. It's called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pizza+shelf">"Pizza Shelf"</a> </p>
						<p>Successful Kickstarter</p>
						<p>$90k in sales in Y1</p>
						<p>Achieved monthly and ongoing profitability in month 10</p>
						<p>Experience in IP work (wrote my own provisional patent app), product design and testing, sales, customer service, logistics planning, demand and awareness building, social media, ecommerce management, digital advertising</p>

					<h1>Having a daughter | wanting to accelerate the plan</h1>
					<p><i>Having a daughter | wanting to accelerate the plan</i></p>
						<p>Pizza Shelf is on a path to replace my income but it's going to take awhile. I now have a daughter and it's becoming more blatantly obvious to me that I'm wasting my time continuing to work at AB. When I come home and look at her, I want, even more, to work on something that will bring joy to her life and make her life better along with every other human being. It became much more tangible now that she is here.</p>
						<p>I have been following your companies for a long time and know that the projects you are working on are ones that align with my goals. If I lived on the west coast, I would have applied years ago, but again, strengthening relationships with family is important to me and until we have earth-to-earth starship, living across the country would make that more difficult, so I hadn't applied previously.</p>
						<p>That brings us to November 20, 2018. I had just left walked out of work in NYC and grabbed a beer for my train back to NJ. On the ride back, I was thinking - as I often do - about the projects you're working on. I decided to type some thoughts and send them to Sam, without context [<a href="https://medium.com/@rotio/elon-musk-is-inventing-toilets-d1bd68f13c36">Elon Musk is Inventing Toilets</a>]. He replied saying we should talk. We did. He seemed to think that I could help at Tesla and that a remote role would be possible. <u>This was a way to short circuit my own plan and jump straight into helping humanity!</u>

					<h1>Tesla</h1>
					<p><i>Tesla</i></p>
						<p>Now we're here, I've interviewed with a bunch of folks (Omead, Sanjay, Shivon, Troy, Lea, Reyna, Sam), sent ideas, some presentations, lots of bullet points. I'm excited by a lot of what you're working on. The results in the Impact Report were remarkable for both generation and consumption. FSD is going to be an Outside Context Problem for most of the world and can be a huge enabler for humans to live better lives. Teslas are still incredibly fun. The teasing of the Tesla Truck gets me every time (please let me say goodbye to my F150). I'm knocking at your door as a swiss army knife of tech and business skills ready to apply them to a worthy project. I'm here because I need to work on something that's going to create a better world for your five boys, my daughter, their grandkids, and everyone else. I want to inspire them and bring joy to their lives while advancing humanity. You're doing that. so I'll run through a damn wall for you. </p>
